# Line of Sight

This project is a proof of concept for calculating whether or not there is line of sight between 2 points on the earth. While there are other tools to achieve this goal, this project aims to do so at lightning speed, while the origin and/or target are in motion.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
